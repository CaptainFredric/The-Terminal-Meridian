# The-Terminal

`The-Terminal` is a Bloomberg-inspired market workspace with a real Flask backend, SQLite persistence, API-backed account sessions, and a multi-panel browser client. It now stores accounts and saved workspaces on the server instead of pretending with browser-only persistence.

## What It Does

- authenticates users through `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, and `/api/auth/session`
- lets signed-in users manage profile, password, and account deletion from the new Account modal
- stores user profiles, session tokens, and workspace state in SQLite
- saves watchlists, alerts, positions, command history, and panel layout per account
- proxies live public market data for quotes, charts, options, news, FX, and secured deep-dive research through the backend
- renders a four-panel terminal workspace with keyboard routing and command-style navigation
- includes portfolio math, options snapshots, macro monitors, and pricing calculators

## Stack

- `backend/app.py` — Flask server, API routes, SQLite wiring, public-market adapters, static asset serving
- `backend/__init__.py` — backend package export for tests and local imports
- `src/clientApp.js` — active browser controller for auth, panel routing, commands, rendering, and autosave
- `src/api.js` — fetch wrapper for auth, workspace, market, and health endpoints
- `src/data.js` — command catalog, module metadata, defaults, and product copy
- `src/styles.css` — terminal-inspired visual system and cockpit layout
- `index.html` — landing view, auth forms, workspace shell, panel layout, and command surface
- `scripts/smoke_test.py` — structural and behavioral smoke test for the current stack
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependency manifest

## System Architecture (Study Guide)

Meridian 1.0 uses a modular frontend where `AppBootstrap` acts as an orchestration layer and delegates behavior to dedicated controllers and renderers.

- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: user actions dispatch commands, commands mutate state through core/controller paths, and renderers project state to the DOM.
- **Proxy-based State Store**: `StateStore` captures mutations and emits subscription events so UI updates and side effects can react consistently.
- **Component-based Rendering Registry**: each module renderer (Quote, Chart, News, Rules, etc.) is registered once and resolved by module key for panel rendering.
- **Debounced Backend Persistence**: `WorkspaceController` batches workspace writes (`queueSave`) and syncs guest/auth states without blocking interactions.

### The Moat: Logic Engine Parser

The `LogicEngine` is Meridian’s core moat: it parses explicit rule syntax (`IF ... THEN ...`) into structured conditions, evaluates them against live quote state, and emits trigger notifications only on state transitions. This provides custom-scripted financial alerts with deterministic behavior and low runtime overhead, avoiding the bulk and complexity of traditional platform scripting stacks.

## Modules

- `HOME` — market pulse, alerts, watchlist tone, and account summary
- `QUOTE` — live quote snapshot with price, volume, range, action buttons, and deep insight blocks
- `CHART` — API-fed candlestick chart for the active symbol and timeframe
- `NEWS` — high-density headlines with source, time, and sentiment
- `EQS` — screener-style market list for tracked names
- `HEAT` — market map view for relative movers
- `PORT` — saved portfolio positions and P/L math
- `MACRO` — FX and macro monitor view
- `OMON` — options chain snapshot by symbol and expiry
- `CALC` — Black-Scholes and bond pricing tools

## API Surface

- `GET /api/health` — backend availability and server time
- `POST /api/auth/signup` — create a user and seed a default workspace
- `GET /api/auth/availability` — check whether email/username are available
- `POST /api/auth/login` — start an authenticated session
- `POST /api/auth/logout` — clear the current session cookie
- `GET /api/auth/session` — restore the active user and workspace
- `PATCH /api/auth/profile` — update first name, last name, username, and role
- `POST /api/auth/password` — change password with current-password verification
- `DELETE /api/auth/account` — delete account, workspace state, and active sessions
- `GET /api/workspace` — fetch saved workspace state
- `PUT /api/workspace` — persist workspace changes
- `GET /api/market/quotes` — quote batch for comma-separated symbols
- `GET /api/market/chart/<symbol>` — chart series for a symbol
- `GET /api/market/options/<symbol>` — option chain snapshot
- `GET /api/market/news` — normalized financial headlines
- `GET /api/market/deep-dive/<symbol>` — backend-proxied company profile, financial data, and ticker-specific news
- `GET /api/market/fx` — FX rates feed

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to enable backend-proxied RapidAPI research locally:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Supported variables:

- `RAPIDAPI_KEY` — RapidAPI key for Yahoo Finance deep-dive modules
- `RAPIDAPI_HOST` — defaults to `yahoo-finance15.p.rapidapi.com`
- `TERMINAL_SECRET` — Flask session secret

## Local Run

1. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Validate the app:

```bash
npm run check
```

3. Start the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`

## Commands

- `HELP`
- `SAVE`
- `NEXT` / `PREV`
- `AAPL Q`
- `MSFT CHART`
- `ANALYZE NVDA`
- `SYNC NVDA`
- `LOGIN` / `SIGNUP`
- `WATCH PLTR`
- `ALERT NVDA 950`
- `ADDPOS QQQ 3 441`
- `OMON AAPL`
- `MACRO`

## Notes

- Passwords are hashed on the server and sessions are stored with an HTTP-only cookie.
- Market data comes from public upstream sources, so availability depends on those feeds.
- RapidAPI credentials stay on the backend and are read from `.env`, not from frontend code.
- SQLite lives under `data/terminal.db` by default and can be overridden in tests via app config.
